The files for the case of the Tangy Pack is in this folder.  

The case has been designed and tested to print in ABS, but as long as you print both the front and back of the case in same material, it should be OK to print in PLA or PETG.  

PLA might be too brittle for Clips.stl so you should print it in PETG or ABS.
